# FAQ


Q: Can I make the bot running a battle every 2 minutes?
A: Technically yes, but playing too often will decrease the Capture Rate making the rewards very low and insignificant. Try to play a battle every 20 minutes MAX to maintain high level of rewards. Trust me, you keep the ROI higher. Don't be greedy.

Q: Does it play for the daily quest?
A: At the moment the bot consider only the splinters quests (death, dragon, earth, fire, life, water) but not the special one (snipe, sneak, neutral,...). Therefore yes, the bot prioritize the splinter for the quest. Nonetheless if the bot consider more probable to win a battle with another splinter (because for example there are not many possible team for the splinter of the quest), you may see a different card selection sometimes

Q: Can I play multiple accounts?
A: Technically yes, but don't be greedy.

Q: I got the error "cannot read property split of undefined"
A: check that the credentials file doesn't contain any but ".env" in the name. (no .txt or anything else) and check that there is nothing but ACCOUNT=yourusername and PASSWORD=yourpass in 2 lines with no spaces. Also you must use the username with the posting key, and not the email address.

Q: Why the bot doesn't use my best card I paid 1000$?
A: Because the bot select cards based on the statistics of the previous battles choosing the most winning team for your cards. it's a bot, not a thinking human being!

Q: Why the bot doesn't use the Furious Chicken?
A: same as above
